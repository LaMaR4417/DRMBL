# DRMBL - League Content Decisions

> Work through each section below. Decisions made here drive what goes on the **Homepage** (League Details section) and the **Rules & Regulations** page.

## 1. Season Structure & Schedule

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Total season length | 11 weeks (10 regular season + 1 playoff Sunday) |
| Season start date | April 2026 |
| Registration deadline | March 20, 2026 |
| Number of regular-season games | 10 per team (guaranteed) |
| Game days | Sundays only |
| Game times | 8 AM – 2 PM (6 games per day, 1-hour slots) |
| How many games per day? | 6 |
| Target number of teams | 12 (max that fits — see math below) |
| Extra teams policy | Only accepted if they can be scheduled for 10 games within 10 weeks |
| Playoff format | Single elimination — #1 vs #4, #2 vs #3 |
| How many teams make playoffs? | Top 4 |
| Playoff seeding criteria | Win/loss record |
| Tiebreaker order | 1) Win/loss record → 2) Point differential (+/−) → 3) Head-to-head |
| Minimum teams to run the league | As many as needed to cover costs (fees + sponsorships) |
| Team drops mid-season | Remaining games become forfeits; opponents get free wins; past results still count |
| Playoff day structure | 4 games — Semi 1, Semi 2, 3rd-place game, Championship |
| Playoff day game order | Semi 1 → Semi 2 → 3rd Place → Championship (gives finalists rest) |
| Championship game — special format? | Full stopped clock |
| All-Star game? | No |

> **Schedule math:** 12 teams × 10 games ÷ 2 (two teams per game) = **60 games**.
> 10 Sundays × 6 games per Sunday = **60 slots**. Perfect fit.
> Each team plays exactly once per Sunday. Week 11 = Playoff Sunday (4 games).
> Adding a 13th+ team would require more than 6 games/Sunday or bye weeks — only accept if the math works.
